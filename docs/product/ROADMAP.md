## Future Architecture Considerations

### When to Consider Next.js Migration
- **Landing page SEO** needs become critical
- **Complex routing** requirements emerge
- **Server-side rendering** for performance
- **Larger team** needs more structure

### Migration Strategy (If Needed)
1. **Components are portable** - React components work in Next.js
2. **Gradual migration** - Start with marketing pages
3. **API compatibility** - Convex functions can be called from Next.js
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Add Next.js features incrementally

The current Vite + Convex approach optimizes for rapid MVP development and should serve us well through significant user growth.
