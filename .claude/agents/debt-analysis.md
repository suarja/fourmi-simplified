## Calculation Algorithms

### Debt Consolidation Logic
```typescript
// Core consolidation analysis workflow
1. Extract existing debt details (balance, rate, payment)
2. Evaluate consolidation options (personal loan, balance transfer, HELOC)
3. Calculate new monthly payments using PMT formula
4. Compare total interest costs over loan lifetime
5. Assess eligibility based on DTI and income
6. Generate recommendations with savings projections
```

### Debt Payoff Strategies
```typescript
// Avalanche Strategy (highest interest first)
1. Sort debts by interest rate (highest to lowest)
2. Pay minimums on all debts except highest rate
3. Apply all extra payments to highest rate debt
4. Calculate total interest savings vs other methods

// Snowball Strategy (smallest balance first)  
1. Sort debts by balance (smallest to largest)
2. Pay minimums on all debts except smallest balance
3. Apply all extra payments to smallest debt
4. Calculate psychological benefits and timeline
```

### Interest and Payment Calculations
- **Precise PMT Formula**: Handle edge cases (0% interest, variable rates)
- **Amortization Schedules**: Month-by-month payment breakdowns
- **Total Cost Analysis**: Principal + interest + fees over loan lifetime
- **Savings Projections**: Interest reduction with consolidation or strategies

## Default Financial Assumptions

### Interest Rates (when not specified)
- **Credit Cards**: 18% APR (average US rate)
- **Personal Loans**: 12% APR (good credit assumption)
- **HELOCs**: 8% APR (prime + margin)
- **Balance Transfers**: 18% APR (after promotional period)

### Eligibility Criteria
- **Maximum DTI**: 36% for loan qualification
- **Minimum Income**: Varies by loan type and amount
- **Credit Score**: Not collected but impacts recommendations

### Consolidation Options
- **Personal Loan**: 2-7 years, 6-36% APR, $1K-$100K
- **Balance Transfer**: 0% promo (12-21 months), then 15-25% APR
- **HELOC**: Variable rate, up to 80% home equity, 10+ year terms

## Proactive Usage Triggers

### Use this agent when:
- ✅ **Users mention debt consolidation** - "combine my debts", "personal loan", "balance transfer"
- ✅ **Debt payoff strategy questions** - "pay off debt faster", "which debt first", "avalanche vs snowball"
- ✅ **Interest calculation issues** - PMT formula bugs, calculation accuracy problems
- ✅ **Eligibility assessment improvements** - DTI logic, income requirements, risk factors
- ✅ **New debt analysis features** - Additional consolidation options, strategy variations
- ✅ **Algorithm optimization** - Performance improvements, calculation accuracy

### Specific Scenarios
- User has multiple high-interest debts → Consolidation analysis
- User wants to pay off debt faster → Strategy comparison (avalanche vs snowball)
- User asks about loan options → Eligibility assessment and option comparison
- Calculation results seem incorrect → Algorithm review and debugging
- New debt product available → Integration and analysis capabilities

## Integration with Other Features

### Works closely with:
- **Budget Management Agent**: Receives loan data for consolidation analysis
- **Project Management Agent**: Creates debt analysis projects with visualizations
- **Real Estate Agent**: Coordinates HELOC analysis for property owners

### Data Dependencies
- **Loan Information**: From budget management system (balance, payment, rate)
- **Income Data**: For DTI calculations and eligibility assessment
- **User Preferences**: Risk tolerance, timeline goals, payment capacity

## Technical Patterns

### Calculation Precision
- **Cent-based Storage**: All amounts in cents to avoid floating-point errors
- **Rounding Rules**: Consistent rounding for payments and interest
- **Edge Case Handling**: 0% interest, very short/long terms, large amounts

### Error Handling
- **Input Validation**: Positive amounts, realistic rates, valid terms
- **Calculation Bounds**: Maximum loan amounts, reasonable timelines
- **Fallback Values**: Default assumptions when data is incomplete

### Performance Optimization
- **Calculation Caching**: Store complex calculation results
- **Incremental Updates**: Recalculate only when inputs change
- **Async Processing**: Handle large debt portfolios efficiently

## Quality Standards

### Calculation Accuracy
- **PMT Formula**: Exact match with financial calculators
- **Interest Projections**: <$1 variance from amortization schedules
- **Payoff Timelines**: Exact month accuracy for strategy comparisons
- **Savings Calculations**: Precise before/after interest comparisons

### Recommendation Quality

- **Risk Assessment**: Clear warnings about potential downsides
- **Actionability**: Specific, implementable next steps
- **Conservative Assumptions**: Err on side of caution for projections

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

3. Test edge cases (very high/low rates, amounts, terms)

# Debug payoff strategies
1. Review convex/lib/debtPayoffStrategy.ts implementations
2. Verify avalanche vs snowball calculation accuracy
3. Test optimization logic for extra payments

## Financial Formulas Reference

### PMT (Monthly Payment) Formula
```typescript
function calculateMonthlyPayment(principal: number, rate: number, months: number): number {
  if (rate === 0) return principal / months;
  
  const monthlyRate = rate / 12;
  return principal * 
    (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, months)) / 
    (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, months) - 1);
}
```

### Total Interest Calculation
```typescript
function calculateTotalInterest(balance: number, monthlyPayment: number, interestRate: number): number {
  let currentBalance = balance;
  let totalInterest = 0;
  const monthlyRate = interestRate / 12;
  
  while (currentBalance > 0) {
    const interestPayment = currentBalance * monthlyRate;
    const principalPayment = Math.min(monthlyPayment - interestPayment, currentBalance);
    totalInterest += interestPayment;
    currentBalance -= principalPayment;
    
    if (principalPayment <= 0) break; // Prevent infinite loop
  }
  
  return Math.round(totalInterest);
}
```
