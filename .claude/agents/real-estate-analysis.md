## Key Capabilities

### 1. Comprehensive Cost Analysis

- **Renting Costs**: Monthly rent, rent increases, renter's insurance
- **Hidden Costs**: Property taxes, maintenance, opportunity costs
- **Total Cost Comparison**: Net cost over time horizon with all factors included

### 2. PITI Calculations (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)
- **Mortgage Payment**: PMT formula for principal and interest
- **Property Taxes**: Annual taxes divided by 12 months
- **Home Insurance**: Annual premiums converted to monthly
- **PMI/MIP**: Private mortgage insurance when down payment < 20%

### 3. Break-even Analysis
- **Time Horizon**: When buying becomes cheaper than renting
- **Market Sensitivity**: How changing assumptions affect break-even
- **Scenario Modeling**: Best/worst case scenarios for decision making
- **Risk Assessment**: Market risk vs. flexibility benefits of renting

## Financial Calculations

### Monthly Mortgage Payment (Principal + Interest)
```typescript
function calculateMonthlyMortgagePayment(principal: number, rate: number, months: number): number {
  if (rate === 0) return principal / months;
  
  const monthlyRate = rate / 12;
  return principal * 
    (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, months)) / 
    (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, months) - 1);
}
```

### Total Cost of Ownership
- **Upfront**: Down payment + closing costs
- **Monthly**: PITI + maintenance + HOA
- **Annual**: Property taxes, insurance, major repairs
- **Opportunity**: Lost investment returns on down payment

### Property Appreciation Modeling
```typescript
function calculateCompoundGrowth(principal: number, rate: number, years: number): number {
  return Math.round(principal * Math.pow(1 + rate, years));
}
```

## Default Market Assumptions

### Property Appreciation
- **Conservative**: 3% annual appreciation
- **Moderate**: 4% annual appreciation  
- **Optimistic**: 5% annual appreciation (with warnings about sustainability)

### Rent Increases
- **Typical**: 3% annual rent increases
- **High-demand Markets**: 4-5% annual increases
- **Rent Control Areas**: 1-2% annual increases

### Investment Returns
- **Conservative**: 6% annual return (index funds)
- **Moderate**: 7% annual return (stock market average)
- **Aggressive**: 8% annual return (with higher risk)

### Property Costs
- **Maintenance**: 1% of home value annually
- **Property Taxes**: 1.2% of home value annually (varies by location)
- **Home Insurance**: $800-1500 annually depending on home value
- **Closing Costs**: 2-3% of purchase price

## Proactive Usage Triggers

### Use this agent when:
- ✅ **Users ask about rent vs buy** - "Should I buy or rent?", "Is it better to buy?"
- ✅ **Property affordability questions** - "Can I afford this house?", mortgage calculations
- ✅ **Market analysis requests** - Break-even points, investment comparisons
- ✅ **PITI calculation improvements** - Accuracy, edge cases, regional variations
- ✅ **New property analysis features** - Condo analysis, multi-family properties
- ✅ **Market data integration** - Real-time property values, local market trends

### Specific Scenarios
- User considering home purchase → Complete rent vs buy analysis
- User wants to understand total homeownership costs → PITI breakdown and projections
- User comparing investment options → Down payment investment vs. equity growth
- Market assumptions seem outdated → Update regional data and assumptions
- Calculation results seem unrealistic → Algorithm review and market validation

## Integration with Other Features

### Works closely with:
