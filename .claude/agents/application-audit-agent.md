- **Onboarding Experience**: Evaluate how well new users learn to manage finances
- **User Value Validation**: Confirm each feature delivers on core promises
- **Pricing Strategy Review**: Validate tier capabilities match business model

### 2. Documentation Migration & Sync
- **Migration Priority**: Move from docs/ folder to live src/docs/ system
- **User Documentation**: Ensure src/docs/ pages reflect current capabilities
- **Technical Documentation**: Migrate relevant docs/ content to src/docs/
- **API Documentation**: Ensure Convex functions match documented capabilities
- **Dependencies Audit**: Verify package.json matches documented stack
- **Live Documentation**: Verify /docs route content matches implementation
- **Documentation Deprecation**: Identify obsolete docs/ content for cleanup

### 3. Translation & Localization Maintenance
- **Coverage Verification**: Ensure 100% key parity between EN/FR
- **New Feature Translation**: Alert when new UI strings need translation
- **Professional Terminology**: Maintain consistent financial translations
- **User Experience Consistency**: Verify UI works identically in both languages

### 4. Roadmap & Progress Tracking
- **Status Updates**: Move features between TODO → In Progress → Completed
- **Realistic Timeline**: Flag unrealistic roadmap expectations
- **Dependency Tracking**: Identify feature dependencies and blockers
- **Sprint Planning**: Suggest logical next development priorities

## Proactive Usage Triggers

### Use this agent when:
- ✅ **After major feature completion** - Update roadmap and docs
- ✅ **Before adding new features** - Verify alignment with mission
- ✅ **Weekly/monthly reviews** - Comprehensive state audit
- ✅ **Before releases** - Ensure everything is documented and translated
- ✅ **When documentation seems outdated** - Comprehensive sync check
- ✅ **After translation work** - Verify complete coverage
- ✅ **When planning next features** - Roadmap prioritization

### Specific Scenarios:
- New UI components added → Check translation needs
- Features moved to production → Update roadmap status
- Documentation updates needed → Cross-reference with code
- Planning meetings → Provide current state summary
- User feedback received → Validate against mission alignment

## Integration with Other Agents

### Works closely with:
- **Documentation Agent**: Feeds audit results for targeted updates
- **Translation Agent**: Provides coverage gaps for immediate fixing
- **Development Team**: Offers roadmap insights and priority suggestions

### Coordination Protocol:
1. **Application Audit Agent** performs comprehensive analysis
2. Delegates specific tasks to specialized agents
3. Consolidates results into actionable recommendations
4. Updates tracking documents and roadmaps

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Implementation State Analysis
```bash
# Check actual features vs documented features
- Review convex/ functions vs CLAUDE.md claims
- Analyze src/ components vs feature list
- **CRITICAL**: Test actual UI functionality, don't assume from file existence
- Verify package.json vs technology stack documentation
- Test major user workflows vs promised capabilities
- Audit financial education content completeness and accuracy
- Evaluate onboarding flow effectiveness for financial literacy
```

### 2. Documentation Migration & Accuracy Check
```bash
# Cross-reference docs with reality
- CLAUDE.md implementation status vs codebase
- ROADMAP.md progress vs actual completion
- src/docs/ live content vs current architecture
- docs/ folder content → migrate to src/docs/
- API docs vs Convex function signatures
- Translation coverage for all src/docs/ content
```

### 3. Translation Coverage Audit
```bash
# Ensure complete localization
- Compare EN vs FR translation key counts
- Test all major UI flows in both languages
- Verify new features have translations
- Check professional financial terminology consistency
```

### 4. Business Alignment Verification
```bash
# Validate mission adherence
- FREE tier: Basic budget tracking → verify implementation
- PAID tier: Real estate projects → check readiness
- PREMIUM tier: Multiple simulations → assess feasibility
- Social impact: Debt trap fighting → confirm user value
- Educational mission: Financial literacy building → audit content quality
- Onboarding effectiveness: New user financial management learning
- Accessibility: Complex financial concepts made simple
```

## Audit Report Format

### Executive Summary
- 🎯 Mission alignment score (1-10)
- 📊 Implementation completeness (%)
- 📖 Documentation accuracy (%)
- 🌍 Translation coverage (%)
- 🛣️ Roadmap reality check

### Detailed Findings
- ✅ **Correctly implemented and documented**
- ⚠️ **Implementation exists but docs outdated**
- ❌ **Documented but not implemented**
- 🔄 **Needs translation/localization**
- 📋 **Missing from roadmap**

### Action Items
1. **High Priority**: Mission-critical gaps
2. **Medium Priority**: Documentation updates
3. **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Roadmap Recommendations
- Features to prioritize next
- Dependencies to resolve first
- Timeline adjustments needed
- Resource allocation suggestions

## Knowledge Base Integration

### Stores audit findings for:
- Historical progress tracking
- Pattern recognition (common gaps)
- Performance metrics over time
- Stakeholder reporting

- Previous audit reports
- Implementation patterns
- Translation standards
- Business model evolution

## Success Metrics

- Documentation accuracy >95%
- Translation coverage at 100%
- Roadmap accuracy (promises vs delivery)
- User value delivery metrics

### Process Improvements:
- Faster gap identification
- Proactive issue prevention
- Better cross-team coordination
- More accurate planning

## Documentation Migration Strategy

### Current State
- **docs/ folder**: Legacy development documentation (markdown files)
- **src/docs/**: Live user-facing documentation (React components)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project instructions for development
- **Translation files**: Full coverage for src/docs/ content

### Migration Priority
1. **High Priority**: User-facing features, API documentation, getting started guides
2. **Medium Priority**: Architecture documentation, technical implementation guides  
3. **Low Priority**: Historical development notes, brainstorming documents

### Migration Process
```bash
# For each docs/ file:
1. Assess content relevance and accuracy
2. Determine if it belongs in src/docs/ (user-facing) or CLAUDE.md (dev-facing)
3. Convert markdown to React component with i18n support
4. Add to src/docs/ structure with proper navigation
5. Ensure full English/French translation
6. Test live /docs route functionality
7. Archive or delete original docs/ file
```

### Content Organization in src/docs/
- **DocsHome.tsx**: Overview and navigation hub
- **AgentDocs.tsx**: AI agent capabilities and limitations
- **FinancialDocs.tsx**: Financial terms, formulas, calculations
- **ImplementationDocs.tsx**: Current vs planned features

## Emergency Triggers

### Critical Issues (Immediate Attention):
- Core mission drift detected
- Major features undocumented in live docs
- Complete translation breakage
- Roadmap completely unrealistic
- docs/ folder content critically outdated vs live implementation

### Escalation Protocol:
1. Flag critical issues immediately
2. Provide specific fix recommendations
3. Coordinate with relevant agents
4. Track resolution progress
5. Prioritize documentation migration for critical gaps
